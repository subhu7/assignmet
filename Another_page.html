    <p>PayPal dominates the digital payment scene. It has upwards of 360 million active users in more than 200 countries
        and facilitated four billion payment transactions in Q3 of 2020 alone. Since 1998, PayPal has been giving
        consumers alternative ways to make purchases and send and receive money online. PayPal lets you pay for things
        online with a bank account instead of a credit card and keeps your payment information hidden from merchants. It
        also makes sending money easy and, in most cases, free. PayPal has essentially made checks and costly wire
        transfer services obsolete.</p>
